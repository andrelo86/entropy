# TEST CASES

## Verify entropy calculation works as expected

## Verify application by default create blocks of 1024 bytes

## Verify application when select block size, works as expected

## Verify no entropy for all same bytes

## Verify high entropy for all random bytes

## Verify application for empty file

## Verify application for file size < defined sub sequence

## Verify results are presented as expected (low < 2, high > 7)
